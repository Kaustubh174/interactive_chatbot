# Chatbot Interaction with OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo

This project implements a simple interactive chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. The chatbot is designed to engage in a conversational format where it can understand and respond to user inputs based on a specified system prompt. It is a versatile tool that can be used for various applications such as customer support, educational purposes, or casual conversation.

The script allows users to set a custom system prompt at the start, which defines the overall behavior and tone of the chatbot. Throughout the interaction, the conversation history is maintained, enabling the chatbot to provide contextually relevant responses. This project is an excellent starting point for those looking to explore natural language processing and conversational AI using OpenAI's powerful language models.

## Features
